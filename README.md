# Real-Time-Data-Synchronization-from-On-Prem-to-Cloud

## Overview

In today's data-driven world, the efficiency and reliability of data access are paramount for organizations. A common challenge is the heavy reliance on on-premises servers for data storage and access. This centralized approach often leads to significant load and pressure on the on-premises infrastructure, impacting performance and accessibility. Our project introduces a solution to alleviate this pressure by replicating on-premises data to a cloud server, thus redirecting data access requests from various organizations to the cloud, away from the on-premises servers.
